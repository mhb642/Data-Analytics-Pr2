==================

Project 2 Repository shared with Xue Qin


In this project we will try to investigate the implementation of the viterbi algorithm on the cloud.

Main Objectives: 
1.   Theoretically how can we implement viterbi in a map-reduce frame work.  




Sources: 
1. Data-Intensive Text processing
2. Maybe using some communication systems sources (like sklar's paper- How I learned the Trellis)
